# React Projects

This repository contains a collection of small projects built to practice and learn React.  
Each project is located in its own directory and can be run independently.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

In a terminal, clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Enzo1745/react-projects.git
```
Navigate into the project folder:
```
cd react-projects
```
Choose one of the project directories, then install dependencies:
```
cd project-folder-name
npm install
```
Start the development server:
```
npm run dev
```
Then, open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:5173/
```
(or whichever port is shown in your terminal)

## Notes

- Each project may use different dependencies, so be sure to run npm install inside each one before starting.
- Feel free to explore, modify, and run each project locally to better understand how they work.
